##  Bridge design pattern 
___

The Bridge design pattern allows you to **separate** the **abstraction** from the **implementation**. It is a structural design pattern.

>The idea behind the OOP is always decouple **abstraction** from **implementation**.

![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Bridge_Design.png)

There are 2 **parts** in Bridge design pattern :

    1 - Abstraction.
    2 - Implementation.

This is a design mechanism that encapsulates an implementation class inside of an interface class.

* The bridge pattern allows the Abstraction and the Implementation to be developed independently and the client code can access only the Abstraction part without being concerned about the Implementation part.
  
* The abstraction is an interface or abstract class and the **implementor** is also an interface or abstract class.
* The abstraction contains a reference to the implementor. Children of the abstraction are referred to as refined abstractions, and children of the implementor are concrete implementors. Since we can change the reference to the implementor in the abstraction, we are able to change the abstractionâ€™s implementor at run-time. Changes to the implementor do not affect client code.
* It increases the loose coupling between class abstraction and itâ€™s implementation.

## Implementation with JavaScript

## First practice

Basically we want to create **Shaps** with mutiple format Circle, Rectangle , Square .. and we have two way to render them ... So we use **Bridge Design Patter** to kind connect those rendrer classes together.
we create VectorRenderer class, RasterRenderer class, In the base class which is the **base** class we need one of those rendrer to handle the operation of rendering.
