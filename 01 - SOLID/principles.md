Solid Principles
S : single resposability 
    For any given class or object ... don't make more than one resposability this will become mess.
O : Open closed principle 
    Means that the class or any component should be open to extension (inheritance ....) and closed for modification (adding methods ...) , never jump to class and modified it.
L : liskov substitusion 
    Basic idea if you have some function takes base type it should also takes the derived type
I : Interface segragation
    we have problem right here because our lovely javascript does not have interfaces
    so we use abstract class even though we don't have abstract class, But we can tweak this one , 
    The principe said that all interfaces should be segregated (splited up)
